### Hi there! 😁

My name is Bruno Silva from Brasil (🇧🇷). I have been working as a front-end developer since 2018 and currently have dedicated myself to Javascript, ES6 and React.

In my free time I like watch soccer ⚽️, to watch movies 🎞️, series and stand-up comedy 📺,  to listen to music 🎵 and enjoying life with a beer and barbecue 🍺.
